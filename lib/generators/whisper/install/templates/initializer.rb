Whisper.user_class = "<%= user_class %>"

# If you want to change the layout that Whisper uses, uncomment and customize these lines:
#
# Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
#   Whisper::ApplicationController.layout "whisper"
# end
#
# By default, these lines will use the layout located at app/views/layouts/whisper.html.erb in your application.
